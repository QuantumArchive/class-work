# Project Week Guidelines

## Upfront Design?

### Purpose of "Design"

* discovery - "what the heck are we doing?"
* get team on same page - "we're doing what?"
* capture decision making
    * tomorrow, you will forget what you decided today
    * avoid different versions of what is true
* not about:
    * detailed specs
    * avoiding change

### Approach

* Wireframe app and various states
* Arrows between the boxes (data flows)
* Outcomes:
    * Router states
        * Data techniques
    * Needed data (and when)
    * Server API

## Adding Features

* Grow, don't Birth
    * Establish a baseline "hello world" app
* Get infrastructure in place
    * Can team members add new stuff to protection
* If you're waiting for _fill in the blank_, you're doing it wrong
    * Mock the missing thing (e.g. hard code data in services)
    * Write a test
* Testing on a week long project
    * Upfront or as needed
        * provides feedback
        * regression protection
    * After - a chore to check a box
    * Manual testing is still testing
    * Be judiscious

## **Team** Project

Project week is a demonstration of your skills as a developer 
(more than technical knowledge, all skills!)

* If your project "works", but nobody wants to work with you anymore = FAIL
* How can you find a way to contribute?
    * Where do you get the most joy?
    * What do you want to do more of?
    * Offer to help
    * Senior Devs are more effective with a pair even if pair is novice
* How can you help others to contribute?
    * Check-in
    * See the big picture
    * help
    * offer opportunities for others to help you
* (being responsible for a feature with no outlet for help is stressful)
* For final project, you are welcome to be the developer you want to be
    * Focus on what you like
    * (but be willing to do some of the dirty work nobody wants to do)
    * Everyone should be willing and able to jump in 
    or be second set of eyes on any part of app
